    <p>This chicken pot pie with cream cheese is easy to make and a wonderful comfort food. It's my husband's favorite meal.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
      <li>3 cups cooked, diced chicken meat</li>
      <li>1/2 (16 ounce) package frozen mixed vegetables, thawed</li>
      <li>2 (9 inch) frozen pie crusts, thawed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Stir condensed soup and cream cheese together in a large mixing bowl until thoroughly blended. Stir in chicken and thawed vegetables.</li>
      <li>Line a 9-inch pie pan with one crust. Pour chicken mixture into crust. Place remaining crust over filling, press to seal the edges, and cut several steam vents in the top. Cover crust edges with aluminum foil to prevent overbrowning.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Remove foil and continue baking, checking often to ensure crust is not burning, until filling is bubbly, 15 to 20 more minutes.</li>
    </ol>
